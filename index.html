<h1><i> About this Project </i></h1>
<section class="first">
<h4>Hybrid Structure</h4>
<p>
This project is a series of pages with dynamic content that explains the relationship between the happiness
and income in different states of the USA. On each page, we show US maps color coded, for different statistics.
Users can hover over each state to obtain more details for better understanding/analyis.
</p>

<h4>Scene Utilization</h4>

<p>

There are five pages:
<ul>
<li>A welcome page that discusses about the project </li>
<li>A data vizualization of the Happiness rank of all the states in the USA </li>
<li>A data vizualization of the relationship between the Happiness and Medain Household Income for all the states in the USA</li>
<li>A data vizualization of understanding the relationship between Happiness and Adjusted Income (Income adjsted for the cost of living in that state)
of all the states in the USA</li>
<li> A conclusion/references page.</li> </ul>
</p>

<h4>Annotations</h4>
<p>
Annotation is represented by a tooltip which displays state name, happiness rank and score, median
household income and adjusted income when the user hovers their mouse over a state on the map of the USA.
As the user moves their mouse away from that state, the annotation associated with that state disappears and
an annotation for the next state they hover over appears.
</p>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<p>
Parameters in this project are:
Reading the input .csv files as a function,
loading JSON data to match the geo-location properties to the .csv data field "state", and
passing color ranges to the domains to fill the maps.
</p>
<h4>Triggers</h4>
<p>
We provide buttons to navigate between pages. Every section is hyper linked to the next section as well the previouse section.
The name of the target section is passed as an input paramter to the button and navgiation bar items.
