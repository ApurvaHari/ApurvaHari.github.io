<h4>Hybrid Structure</h4>
<p>
This project is a series of pages with dynamic content that explains the relationship between the happiness
and income in different states of the USA. On subssequent pages, US maps are color coded, for different statistics.
Users can hover over each state to obtain more details for better understanding/analyis.
</p>

<h4>Scene Utilization</h4>

<p>

There are five pages:
<ul>
<li>A welcome page that discusses about the project </li>
<li>A data vizualization of the Happiness rank of all the states in the USA </li>
<li>A data vizualization of the relationship between the Happiness and Medain Household Income for all the states in the USA</li>
<li>A data vizualization of understanding the relationship between Happiness and Adjusted Income (Income adjsted for the cost of living in that state)
of all the states in the USA</li>
<li> A conclusion/references page.</li> </ul>
</p>

<h4>Annotations</h4>
<p>
Annotation is represented by a tooltip which displays state name, happiness rank and score, median
household income and adjusted income when the user hovers their mouse over a state on the map of the USA.
As the user moves their mouse away from that state, the annotation associated with that state disappears and
an annotation for the next state they hover over appears.
</p>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<p>
Parameters in this project are:
At the bottom of every page, there is a page indicator and pagination is used to navigate through each page
as well as indicate the current page.
Additionally, a navigation bar on the first page at the top, lets the user select which page to navigate.

<h4>Triggers</h4>
<p>

Navigation is provided at the bottom of every page.
As the user navigates from page 1 to page 2, we use the same annotation for the happiness rank chart, and add new
chart.
Similarly, As the user navigates from page 1 to page 3, we use the same annotation for the happiness rank chart, and add new
