<h1> Move to Utah! </h1>
<h2> Conclusions </h2>
<ul>
  <li class="final"> Utah, Minneasota and North Dakota are the top 3 happiest states! </li>
  <li class="final"> While median income explains states that are least happy, it doesn't
    show any clear correlationfor the states where the happiness rank is high </li>
  <li class="final">When we adjust the income based on cost of living, it correlates well with some of the happy states.
    However, the total income is a better indicator for the unhappy states </li>
  <li class="final"> Money cannot completely explain happiness. There are many other factors that need to be accounted for,
    when calculating the happiness </li>
  </ul>

<h2> Discussion </h2>

<p class ="last"> For this project, the data obtained is not for the same year. However, I think the happiness and income rankings are long
  term trends which means that the data from a span of a couple of years should have a minimum impact on the analysis </p>
